i want to build an exe file in python with the following code as its mode of operation-
import os
import sys
import time

sdk_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'terminator', 'python-sdk'))
if sdk_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, sdk_path)

from desktop_use import DesktopUseClient, ApiError

def automate_notepad():
    client = DesktopUseClient(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:9375")

    try:
        # 1. Open Notepad
        print("Opening Notepad...")
        client.open_application("notepad")
        time.sleep(2)  # Wait for Notepad to fully open

        # 2. Locate the Notepad window and the text editor
        print("Locating Notepad window...")
        editor = client.locator('window:Notepad')

        # 3. Type text
        print("Typing text...")
        editor.type_text("Hello from Terminator!\nThis is a Python test.")

        # 4. Open Save As dialog
        print("Opening Save As dialog...")
        editor.press_key("{Ctrl}s")

        # 5. Locate Save As dialog and type name in filename field
        print("Filling Save As dialog...")
        save_dialog = client.locator('window:"Save As"').type_text("Test.txt")
        time.sleep(2)  # Wait for the text to be typed

    except ApiError as e:
        print(f"API Error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    automate_notepad()


the name should be TrackInitializationSetup

also it should be functioning like any other app installation setup where it asks for only the filename input in the gui and then execute the program, and should exit only when the file is saved by the user
