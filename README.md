# SlothState

> Turn User Actions into Smarter Interfaces.

---

## üìå Problem Statement
 
**PS 5: Power Productivity with Screenpipe**

---

## üéØ Objective

Our project solves the challenge of understanding and improving user experience on websites and landing pages-a common pain point for product teams, marketers, and designers. Traditional analytics tools provide raw numbers (like page views or bounce rates) but fail to reveal *why* users abandon forms, miss key features, or get frustrated.

**Real-world use case:**
A SaaS startup launches a new landing page and wants to boost signups. With our tool, they can automatically capture every user interaction-clicks, scrolls, form entries, and more. The system analyzes this behavioral data using LLM API callings and delivers clear, actionable insights:

- ‚ÄúMost users abandon the signup form at the password step.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúMobile users rage-click on the pricing toggle.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúHighlighting the CTA button could increase conversions.‚Äù

**Who it serves:**

- Product managers and designers seeking to optimize UX
- Marketers aiming to increase conversions
- Founders and growth teams who want to quickly identify and fix friction points without hiring analytics experts

**Value provided:**

- **Actionable recommendations** instead of overwhelming dashboards
- **Faster iteration:** Teams can spot and resolve usability issues in hours, not weeks
- **Higher conversions and happier users:** By fixing what matters most, businesses see real improvements in engagement and revenue

In short, our project empowers anyone to turn user behavior into smarter, more effective digital experiences.

## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`DC`

### Team Members:  
- Harshit Mathur 
- Tanay 
- Ayush Barnwal  

### Your Approach:  

*Why we chose this problem:*
- Noticed developers frequently struggle with manual, error-prone setup of dependency files, slowing onboarding and increasing inconsistencies.
- Saw that teams often lack visibility into where and why users get stuck, as traditional analytics only provide surface-level metrics.
- Wanted to bridge the gap by combining real-time user interaction tracking with intelligent automation, so teams can both understand and resolve issues as they happen.

*Key challenges we addressed:*
- Needed to capture and interpret large volumes of user interaction data without overwhelming our analysis or missing important signals.
- Focused on filtering and aggregating data to highlight only the most meaningful patterns for actionable insights.
- Ensured automated actions, like setting up dependency files, were reliable and adapted to different user environments.
- Leveraged advanced UI automation to handle manual tasks, while integrating a tracking system for transparency and auditability.
- Balanced delivering deep insights with maintaining efficiency, by developing strategies to summarize and prioritize recommendations for users of all technical backgrounds.

*Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking:*
- Initially considered focusing only on analytics, but realized that insights alone weren‚Äôt enough without the ability to act on them.
- Shifted to integrating automation, allowing the system to not only identify issues but also assist in resolving them.
- Experimented with various methods for capturing user interactions, finding that combining high-fidelity tracking with intelligent automation yielded the best results.
- Brainstormed ways to maximize transparency and trust, ensuring every automated action could be traced and reviewed.
- Adopted a holistic approach that integrates real-time insights with proactive automation, enabling a solution that both reveals and removes friction from the user journey.

- Uses advanced AI models to analyze this data, identifying patterns, bottlenecks, and friction points that traditional analytics often miss.

### *2. Actionable, Personalized UI Recommendations*
- Instead of just numbers or charts, the platform delivers clear, actionable suggestions for UI/UX improvements (e.g., ‚ÄúMove the CTA button higher,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSimplify form step 3‚Äù).
- Recommendations are tailored to real user behavior, enabling data-driven design decisions and rapid iteration.

### *3. Friction Point Detection*
- Automatically detects where users get stuck, abandon forms, or rage-click-helping teams quickly spot and fix usability issues that hurt conversions.

### *4. Real-Time and On-Demand Insights*
- Teams can generate new insights on demand or at regular intervals, ensuring the dashboard always reflects the latest user behavior and trends.

### *5. Metrics Overview and Trend Analysis*
- Provides daily metrics such as sessions, conversions, average session duration, bounce rate, and conversion rate-all calculated from actual user events.
- Includes trend analysis and change tracking to highlight improvements or regressions over time.

### *6. Secure, Privacy-First Data Handling*
- All user data is anonymized and protected by strict security rules, ensuring only authorized users can access analytics and insights.

## üèÅ Final Words

Participating in this hackathon has been an intense, rewarding, and truly transformative journey. From the very first brainstorming session, our team was driven by the desire to solve a real user pain point and to push our technical skills beyond their comfort zone. Like many hackathon teams, we faced our share of challenges-tight deadlines, unexpected bugs, and the constant need to prioritize what really mattered for our MVP. There were late nights, moments of doubt, and plenty of rapid learning as we navigated new APIs and frameworks on the fly.

One of the biggest lessons we learned was the power of adaptability and teamwork. Collaborating closely, sharing quick wins and setbacks, and keeping our focus on the end user made all the difference. We also realized how important it is to embrace the struggle-every error and every ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment became a stepping stone to deeper understanding and better solutions. The hackathon mindset-building fast, learning constantly, and iterating with purpose-has left a lasting impact on how we approach software development.

A special shoutout goes to **Divanshu from the organising team**, who was incredibly generous with his time and expertise. His guidance helped us integrate screenpipe's terminator smoothly and debug tricky edge cases, and we truly couldn‚Äôt have shipped our dependency automation feature without his help.

Looking back, the most fun moments were those little victories: seeing our first AI-generated insight appear on the dashboard, watching real user interactions flow into our analytics in real time, and demoing the finished product to mentors and friends. While we‚Äôre proud of what we built, we‚Äôre even more grateful for the growth, connections, and inspiration this experience has brought us.

To anyone considering their first hackathon: jump in! Every challenge is a chance to learn, create, and connect. We can‚Äôt wait to see where this project-and the skills we‚Äôve gained-will take us next
